- Tool /class which implements Future<T> with many useful methods to process, combine results and handle errors in a functional style
- Uses fork join pool for async tasks
- Can use virtual thread per task executor for IO tasks
- Limitation - it implements Future. But cancel method doesn't interrupt the thread running the task
